Originally used in \"A gene ontology inferred from molecular networks\" doi:10.1038/nbt.2463","body":"### AlignOntology\r\nThis code can be used to align any two ontologies where terminal nodes are uniquely identified by their names.  Origionally, this code was created to align pairs of gene ontologies for \"[A gene ontology inferred from molecular networks](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n1/full/nbt.2463.html)\" doi:10.1038/nbt.2463.
